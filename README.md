<h1>Serverus Craftus- The Minecraft Server Status Checking App</h1>
<h3>Created by: Megan Piotrowski</h3>
<p>This app was created for our COMP 3025 class and is primarily written in Kotlin.</p>

<br/>

<p>Did you ever want to check the server status of your favourite Minecraft server, only to realize that you forgot the IP? Well we have a solution for you! Introducing Serverus Craftus, an easy to use and powerful app made to lookup the status of servers and save the pesky IPs so you can check them later!</p>

<br />
<h3>Changes Since Release</h3>
<p>These are the things which have been changed since the last release:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Added a check that the user is connected to a stable internet connection before attempting to either add to the database or check the server status</p></li>
	<li><p>Moved the descriptions for the "About" and "Bug Report" pages to strings.xml</p></li>
	<li><p>Added a progress bar which displays while the server status is being located</p></li>
	<li><p>Hid the button to add the server to "My Servers" before it has been error checked and the status has been found to be either offline or online</p></li>
</ul>
