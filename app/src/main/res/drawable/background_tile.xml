<!-- thanks to Tony Lukasavage for explaining how to tile images as a background (http://tonylukasavage.com/blog/2011/06/01/android-quick-tip-tiling-a-background-image/)-->
<!-- FYI: the endstone.png file used in this tile background does not shrink in size when trying to convert to webp, thus it is left as a png file -->
